-- `(λx.x) a` reduces to `a`
-- >>> reduce (App (Abs "x" (Var "x")) (Var "a")) == (Var "a")
-- True

-- `(λx.x x) (λx.x)` reduces to `λx.x`
-- >>> reduce (App (Abs "x" (App (Var "x") (Var "x"))) (Abs "x" (Var "x"))) == (Abs "x" (Var "x")) 
-- True

-- `(λx.λy.x y) y` reduces to `λy1.y y1`, and not `λy.y y`
-- >>> reduce (App (Abs "x" (Abs "y" (App (Var "x") (Var "y")))) (Var "y")) == (Abs "y1" (App (Var "y") (Var "y1")))
-- True

-- Note: The above test case is too britle since its success depends on the choice of the fresh variable `y1` chosen to avoid variable capture.
-- To make the test more robust, it would be better to check that the two terms are alpha equivalent instead. 
-- Note: Checking if two terms are alpha equivalent is not part of the minimum goal.

-- `(λx.λy.x y) y` reduces to a term that is alpha equivalent to `λz.y z`
-- >>> alphaEq (reduce (App (Abs "x" (Abs "y" (App (Var "x") (Var "y")))) (Var "y"))) (Abs "z" (App (Var "y") (Var "z")))
-- True 


--Notes and Hints (will be continuously updated):
--In case you can't figure out how to start implementing beta reduction, I recommend that you look at how this is done in the lecture notes for inspiration. Here is a rough suggestion on how to start:
--
--Implement a function freeVars t that returns a set of all free variables within a lambda term t. You may want to represent sets as lists without duplicates. Appendix A.2 of the lecture notes contains recursive definitions of non-freeness that you may find useful.
--Implement a function substitute (x,tx) t that replaces all free occurrences of the variable x within the term t with the term tx. Take care to avoid capturing substitutions (you will have to do some alpha renaming with fresh variables to avoid this). Appendix A.2 of the lecture notes contains a recursive definition of substitution that you may find useful. In case you find the task of avoiding variable capture too challenging, skip this and only use terms with unique bound and free variable names.
--Implement a function isBetaRedex t which returns True iff the top level of the term t is a beta redex.
--Use substitute to implement a function betaReduce t that applies a beta reduction to top level of the term t.
--You can now combine the functions just defined to define new functions such as:
--leftmostOutermost :: Term -> Term, leftmostInnermost :: Term -> Term that perform a single reduction step using the appropriate evaluation strategy.
--derivation :: (Term -> Term) -> Term -> [Term] that performs a step by step derivation using a given reduction strategy.
--reduce :: Term -> Term that uses returns the beta normal form of a given term in case it exists. (Minimal Goal)


------------------------------------------------

-- I had a hard time understanding how exactly lambda calculus works
-- (problematic was also the app implementation, which is essentially just brackets....)
-- below you can find all the different variations that I have tried
-- At least the basics should now work

--reduce (App (Abs a b) (Abs c d))
--    | isBeta (App (Abs a b) (Abs c d)) = (App (Abs a b) (Abs c d))
 --   | isBound (App (Abs x y ) z) = reduce (betareduce (alphareduce (App (Abs x y ) z)))
--    | otherwise = reduce (betareduce (alphareduce (App (Abs a b) (Abs c d))))

--reduce (App (Abs x y) (App (Var a) (Var b)))
--    | isBeta (App (Abs x y) (App (Var a) (Var b))) = (App (Abs x y) (App (Var a) (Var b)))
 --   | isBound (App (Abs x y ) z) = reduce (betareduce (alphareduce (App (Abs x y ) z)))
--    | otherwise = reduce (betareduce (alphareduce (App (Abs x y) (App (Var a) (Var b)))))
